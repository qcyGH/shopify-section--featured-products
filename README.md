## Description

This is section for Shopify. Made with liquid, JavaScript, CSS (SCSS). Section about featured products. Products are taken from a collection that can be selected in the settings. Adding a product to the cart takes place without reloading the page. Adding a product to the cart displays the pop-up cart of the Dawn theme. Also, adding a product to the cart updates the list of products in the section.

## How to use

You just need to download these files and paste them into your theme. I always use themekit to work with them. After that, in the admin panel in the theme settings you can add this section to your store. Don't forget to select a collection in the section settings.

Also project has scss files, you can customize css properties to adapt to your theme. They are not required for the section to work, you can delete them if you do not need to configure them.
